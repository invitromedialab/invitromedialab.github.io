    <p>
      &Lambda;-7 is a robot that employs the same artificial neural network as the virtual agents.
      Just as it was beginning to learn how to move, we interrupted its training process and allowed
      it to directly control a real physical robot. Although the virtual and physical robots share
      identical bodies, and the simulated world closely approximates ours in various parameters,
      once this "soul" gains a real body and enters the physical world, can it still move as freely
      as it did in the virtual environment?
    </p>
    <p>
      The work probes the gap between symbolic learning in simulation and embodied action in reality,
      questioning how such differences shape AI behavior and our future coexistence with intelligent systems.
