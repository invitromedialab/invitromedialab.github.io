      The continental shelf is like a giant, with the caves representing its inner body. The search for the center of the land will never yield a result because the land is essentially a constantly moving and metabolizing island.
      Organisms self-generate, much like a video game program, being their own code and abiding by their own laws. However, the path to autonomy is the most challenging one.
      Standing at the center of the continental shelf connects human imagination with machine imagination, situating technological objects and the human society built upon them in the context of biological history.
