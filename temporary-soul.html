    <h1>Temporary Soul</h1>
    <p>Interactive video game</p>
    <p>2024–2025</p>
    <p>
      In this project, we showcase artificial intelligence at different stages of training.
      The protagonists of <em>Temporary Soul</em> are AI-driven bacteriophages controlled by
      reinforcement learning algorithms. They have adapted to their virtual bodies and simulated
      environments, moving freely within these spaces. Due to a degree of "autonomy," players
      cannot fully control the characters but can only guide them using small spheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to biological beings, these AIs experience a constant state of "hunger" during
      training and perceive the "pain" of falling. Driven by these pressures, they gradually
      learn to walk and forage. The work reflects on how symbolic learning and embodied cognition
      produce different emergent behaviors in AI systems.
